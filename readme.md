## Ghost Sitemap Generator

Ghost sitemap generator is robust npm module to create sitemaps for your ghost blog like a breeze.

I setup a ghost blog and realised there is no easy way to generate and publish sitemaps for your ghost blog. Bamm!

Ideally it shouldn't be that hard to generate one as ghost is minmal and focused blogging platform so i wrote one.

### Features

* Generate posts , pages, tags and index sitemap
* Easy to configure using sitemapfile.json file
* Ping google and bing about your new sitemap

### Commands

Make sure you run all commands from the root of your ghost project

* ** ghostSitemap init ** - To generate config file
* ** ghostSitemap generate ** - To generate a series of sitemaps
* ** ghostSitemap ping [arguments] ** - To ping google and bing
